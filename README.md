# TextBraTS

A volume-level text-image public dataset with novel text-guided 3D brain tumor segmentation from BraTS challenge.

---

## Introduction

**TextBraTS** is an open-access dataset designed to advance research in text-guided 3D brain tumor segmentation. It includes paired multi-modal brain MRI scans and expertly annotated radiology reports, enabling the development and evaluation of multi-modal deep learning models that bridge vision and language in neuro-oncology. Our work has been accepted by MICCAI 2025. The paper is also available on [arxiv:2506.16784](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16784).

- Developing and benchmarking text-guided segmentation models
- Evaluating multi-modal fusion algorithms in medical imaging
- Research in language-driven medical AI

## Installing Dependencies
Run the following commands to set up the environment:
<pre>conda env create -f environment.yml 
pip install git+https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI.git@07de215c </pre>
If you need to activate the environment, use:
<pre>conda activate TextBraTS </pre>

## Dataset

Due to BraTS official guidelines, MRI images must be downloaded directly from the [BraTS 2020 challenge website](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/data.html) (training set).
 
**Download our text, feature, and prompt files:**  
You can download our dataset from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i1R6_bVY4VbNtxEIQVsiXUSWuVAtgJhg/view?usp=sharing) or [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jupitern52/TextBraTS).
Our provided text reports, feature files, and prompt files are named to match the original BraTS folder IDs exactly. You can set the path and simply merge them with the downloaded MRI data by `merge.py`. 
<pre>python merge.py</pre>

If you would like to change the dataset split, please modify the `Train.json` and `Test.json` files accordingly. 

## Inference

We provide our pre-trained weights for direct inference and evaluation.  
Download the weights from [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/147283LL2fRDcTYR_vQA-95vbZysjjD1v/view?usp=sharing).

After downloading, place the weights in your desired directory, then run the `test.py` with following command for inference:

<pre>python test.py --pretrained_dir=/path/to/your/weights/ --exp_name=TextBraTS</pre>

## Training

If you would like to train the model from scratch, you can modify the training code `main.py` and please use the following command:

<pre>python main.py --distributed --use_ssl_pretrained --save_checkpoint --logdir=TextBraTS</pre>

- The `--use_ssl_pretrained` option utilizes the pre-trained weights from NVIDIA's Swin UNETR model.
- Download the Swin UNETR pre-trained weights from [Pre-trained weights](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FJ0N_Xo3olzAV-oojEkAsbsUgiFsoPdl/view?usp=sharing).
- Please place the downloaded weights in the appropriate directory as specified in your configuration or script.

Edema is prominent, mainly observed in the peripheral areas of the lesions, particularly in the left parietal lobe, extensive, spreading into the adjacent normal brain tissue. Necrosis is observed within the lesions of the left parietal lobe, exhibiting uneven signal intensity, interspersed with both high and low signals, primarily centered in the middle of the lesions, with scattered necrotic tissue present at the periphery. Ventricular compression is observed with the left lateral ventricle noticeably compressed and deformed."

Edema is observed around the lesions, extending over a large area from the anterior portion of the frontal lobe to the posterior part of the parietal lobe, covering a vast region of brain tissue, predominantly showing high signals. Necrosis is present, with mixed signal characteristics, located primarily in the left frontal lobe and left parietal lobe. Ventricular compression is significant in the left lateral ventricle, resulting in deformation and displacement, while the right lateral ventricle exhibits relatively mild compression but still shows some degree of deformation."

    "Original_Text": "The lesion area is in the left frontal lobe with a significant high-signal region, left temporal lobe with high-signal regions, and left parietal lobe with several spotty high-signal regions. Edema is pronounced in the left frontal lobe and a large area in the left parietal lobe, suggesting significant swelling of surrounding tissues. Necrosis is suggested by mixed low-signal areas in the left frontal lobe and dispersed low-signal regions in the left parietal lobe. Ventricular compression is mild, primarily observed near the left frontal and parietal lobes."

Edema is significant, surrounding the lesions in the left temporal and parietal regions with mild edema signals in the frontal lobe. Necrosis is present, with multiple necrotic signal areas characterized by lower signal in the left temporal region and smaller low-signal necrotic areas in the middle of the left parietal lobe. Ventricular compression is significant, particularly notable deformation of the left ventricle."

Edema is significant in the tissue surrounding the lesions, particularly in the left parietal lobe of the brain with high signals. Necrosis is apparent low-signal areas in the left parietal region of the brain, with mixed signals, characterized by low-signal patches within the high-signal regions. Ventricular compression is slight but maintains a generally acceptable shape."
